<h1>Master Services Agreement</h1>
<p>This Master Services Agreement defines the terms and conditions of the working agreement between Inventum Digital, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (herein "Agency"), and <span data-source="account.client.entity.name"></span> ("<span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span>" or "Client") collectively referred to herein as "Parties."</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h2>Recitals</h2>
        <p>WHEREAS <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> desires to engage Agency for its services and Agency desires to provide such services to <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> as described in the Statement of Work ("SOW"),</p>
        <p>NOW, therefore, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree as follows:</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>"Work" shall mean the services described in the SOW that are agreed to by both Parties and to be performed by Agency.</p>
        <p>"Bid" shall mean the Agency’s proposal for the terms of the Work listed in the SOW to be completed for <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span>.</p>
        <p>"Responsible Party" shall mean the individual representative of <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> that will be responsible for retrieving all necessary information for the Agency and reviewing and approving all Work completed by Agency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Commencement of Services</h2>
        <p>Parties hereby agree that Agency shall perform the Work under the terms of this MSA and the SOW.</p>
        <p>Agency’s Work will begin once the conditions outlined within the SOW have been met.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Payment and Bids</h2>
        <p>Unless otherwise agreed in the SOW, the payment terms of this Section shall govern the payment for services rendered under this MSA. <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> shall provide a non-refundable down-payment of 50% of project price to Agency before Agency commences work on a project and the balance to the Agency upon completion of a project. Unless otherwise agreed to, Agency must receive full payment before any completed Work will be transferred to <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span>. If <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> has any past due balances, interest on such balances is to be paid to Agency at a rate of 2% per month, compounded monthly. Partial payments on due balances is accepted, but the owed balance is considered late if not paid in full by the due date. Interest will accumulate on the owed balance until both the payments and interest are paid in full. In the event that payments are declined by the credit card provider, bank, or other financial service, a declined transaction fee will be assessed.</p>
        <p>If Agency has made a Bid for Work in the SOW, Bid pricing is fixed and includes only Work that is listed in the SOW. Bid pricing is valid only if the SOW is signed within 15 days of <span data-source="project.start">the date listed on the SOW</span> and <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> has paid Agency 50% of the Bid or such other percentage of the Bid as the Parties shall have agreed to in writing. Any services performed by Agency for or on behalf of the client beyond the Work detailed and outlined in the SOW will be billed at an hourly rate of $299.95, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties. <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> will be notified of price changes (if any) throughout the term of this MSA before such changes take effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Out-of-Pocket &amp; Travel Expenses</h2>
        <p><span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred during Agency’s completion of Work under the SOW. Out-of-pocket expenses include, but are not limited to, purchase of stock photo images, printing, color printouts, laminating, illustrations, separations, shipping and handling, and courier services. Parties acknowledge that <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> shall provide any and all materials and equipment that may be required by Agency to complete the Work, including any intellectual property such as logos and stylebooks. If <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> should direct Agency at any time to cancel, terminate, or "put on hold" making any previously authorized out-of-pocket expense, Agency will promptly put such expense on hold but <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> shall remain responsible and liable for all outstanding expenses and hold Agency harmless for any costs incurred in terminating or putting an expense "on hold."</p>
        <p>If Agency is required to travel more than 50 miles from the Loop, Chicago, IL, on behalf of <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span>, <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> shall be responsible for all lodging, meal, rental, and transportation expenses incurred by Agency and its staff during the course of such travel. If Parties agree that reimbursement for transportation shall be based on mileage, mileage shall be calculated at the current allowable rates outlined by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Modifications &amp; Additions</h2>
        <p>If <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> requests that Agency complete any services beyond the Work listed in the SOW, such additional services shall be considered a modification or addition to the SOW. If a modification or addition alters the services described in the SOW by increasing the original estimated project price or hours by more than 12.5% the Agency and <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> must agree to and sign a modified SOW before Agency will continue or commence the project Work. Any delays caused by an addition or modification, or proposed addition or modification, shall not alter the payment schedule nor constitute a breach of this MSA.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Scheduled Meetings</h2>
        <p><span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> acknowledges and agrees that the assigned Responsible Party shall be directly involved in the entire project and must participate in all planned meetings during the project including initial design presentation(s) and progress meetings unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.</p>
        <p>For projects spanning greater than one month, <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> is entitled to two meetings with the Inventum Digital core operating group per month.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Property &amp; Third Party Performance</h2>
        <p>Agency is not responsible for loss, destruction, damage, or unauthorized use by others of <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span>’s property.

    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Deadlines</h2>
        <p>Parties agree that any deadlines or timelines outlined within the SOW shall be contingent upon full cooperation from <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span>. <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> understands and agrees:</p>
        <p>I. It must provide all content and material requested by Agency in a reasonable time frame or within a period of time as agreed to by both parties.</p>

From time to time, as agreed to by both Parties, Agency will provide to <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> content and material which require prompt approval from <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> or a third party. Unless otherwise agreed to, if <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> does not explicitly approve or disapprove, and <span data-source="account.client.entity.dba"></span> does not solicit third party approval or disapproval, of the content or material in a timely manner (or in a timeframe defined within the SOW) then such content and material shall be deemed to be approved.</p>
        <p>V.
